Student Performance Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

Description:-
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict a student's percentage score based on the number of study hours. The dataset consists of two variables: the number of study hours (input) and the percentage score (output). The aim is to find a linear relationship between these two variables and use this relationship to make predictions.

Features:-
>Data Visualization: Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between study hours and percentage scores.

>Model Training: Use of scikit-learn's LinearRegression to train the model on the provided dataset.

>Prediction: Making predictions based on the trained model.

>Evaluation: Evaluation of the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
